    "I was asked to put together a brief course explaining Machine Learning in Python for a Discord server I'm in. I will assume you can code in Python and understand basic calculus. Beyond that, everything you need should be explained at some point in the course. I will assume familiarity with Python modules such as matplotlib, numpy, and random, but advanced ML modules like keras and tensorflow will be explained in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "I may adapt this as I progress, but the planned outline for the course is this:-\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1: Optimization: we will create simple optimization problems in discrete and continuous domains and test common optimization algorithms such as random search, gradient descent, and the genetic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2: Supervised and Unsupervised learning: we will use the optimization algorithms we learned in part 1 to complete some simple supervised learning and unsupervised learning problems. We will also introduce linear regression and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3: Classification: we will implement K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model algorithms as classifiers and see that they can perform well at classifying data into classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4: Dimensionality reduction: principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) will be used to reduce large data sets to something more managable for downstream ML tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5: Simple Neural Networks: we'll implement a perceptron from scratch and train it to act as a simple logic gate. Then we'll use established modules to build more complex neural networks and test them on harder tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6: Advanced Neural Networks: here's where we'll play around with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), transformers, long-short-term-memory models (LSTMs) and other advanced neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 7: Other ML architectures: we'll encounter random forest and any other machine learning architectures which didn't yet come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8: GANs: here we'll implement a generative adversarial network and use it to augment complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am also interested in reinforcement learning and AI Safety, so if I get this far I may go on to build subsequent courses on these areas or extend this course to include projects on them. The course itself will be hosted on my GitHub but I'm mostly building it for Discord, so if you have any questions or want me to include anything I haven't yet mentioned, feel free to contact me on either Discord or GitHub!"

    "I have tried to structure the course such that later lessons build on earlier lessons. If you are sure that you already understand something then feel free to skip ahead, but if you are lost it's best to check earlier sections. Each lesson will have a number e.g. \"Lesson 1.0.1.E. Random Search\" and a list of previous lesssons it relies on, so if something does not make sense check the listed lessons. The first number indicates the section (\"1\" for being in the optimization project), the next lists dependencies within the project; 1.1.1 would rely on you knowing everything from 1.0.X; and the last number is just a counter, so there's no reason not to do 1.0.2 before 1.0.1 if you prefer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The letter at the end indicates whether the lesson is essential for subsequent lessons \"E\" or just an interesting tangent \"N\". If your goal is to get to advanced stuff as quickly as possible you'll probably want to skip all the \"N\"s, but if you want stronger foundational knowledge they're worth reading. Also, after E/N lessons I will often give tasks, either in the form of programming assignments or of questions to answer. Any notebook labelled \"A\" contains my answers to those questions or that assignment. You will learn best if you answer the questions and attempt the assignment before checking any \"A\" notebooks."

However, I will aim to add at least one lesson every week until the course is done. A lot of the course content overlaps with repositories I already have on my GitHub, so if you're hungry for more feel free to look at those and hopefully they will keep your interest while I find the time to build the course up.

    "\n",
    "Traditional computer programming relies on humans giving explicit instructions to the computer: \"if X, do Y, otherwise, do Z\". This is enough for a wide range of interesting behaviours but it isn't everything a computer can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, machine learning is about having a computer solve a problem where we *don't explicitly and deterministically tell it exactly what to do*. Either we are exploiting randomness to have the machine figure something out we couldn't figure out deterministically, or we are having the computer learn the correct behaviour rather than explicitly programming it in. This allows us to perform tasks that would have been very hard with standard if-then programming: for example, suppose we have a list of everything someone watched on a streaming site: what else are they likely to watch? What if we have a list of millions of financial transactions, how do we know which ones are fraudulent? \n",
    "\n",
    "You *can* try to solve these probblems with standard programming but it's hard and you probably won't be very successful. But machine learning lets us throw a bunch of data at the problem and see what sticks. It is a very powerful tool!"
